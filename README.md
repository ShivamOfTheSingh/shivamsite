# My Website
Created using React+Vite and JavaScript, this is my personal portfolio website

## Home Page
A welcoming homepage, with a retrowave styled animation. A typewriter animation used to give the welcoming text. p5.js was used to randomly generate valley shaped terrain using perlin noise and noise manipulation.

## Projects Page
Containing my GitHub profile information & my repos with dynamic configurations. Uses GitHub's REST API to show statistics, recent repositories, and much more. Meow /ᐠ｡ꞈ｡ᐟ\
> Work in Progress!

## Contacts Page
A soothing background of particles moving in a smooth flow using p5.js. Currently working on the backend for email contacting, and connecting my socials.
> Work in Progress!

## About Me Page
A pop of color to my website, the About Me page gives fun facts about myself and displays interactive 3D models using three.js and react-three-fiber.

### Navbar
Theming was also created for a dark mode and light mode theme. Seamless page routing via react router.
